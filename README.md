# Baseball_Data_Science
Baseball_Data_Exploration_and_Preprocessing notebook is the first step in data exploration by importing appropriate files and dataframes. These dataframes were analyzed by assessing linear regressions and visualizations. The notebook analyzes the question: How can salaries of baseball players be predicted based on their game performance and popularity? 

The Initial_Visualizations notebook visualizes potential relationships between columns in baseball data. For example, we explored the relationship between Batting, Pitching, HallOfFame, AwardsSharePlayers, and salary. The relationship between fielding and salary proved to be the strongest. 

OLS_regression_results notebook performs linear regression analysis and fits a best-fit line on a scatter plot to predict the dependent variable based on one or multiple independent variables. The best-fit line represents the best model that minimizes absolute error from the dispersed scatter point.

The report will discuss the focus problem and introduce background information on baseball data for analysis interpretation. Potential features will be explained with visualizations like histograms and scatterplots to provide an overall understanding of the baseball data. Linear regressions analysis will analyze the best-fit line that minimizes absolute error based on the context of baseball. Then, actionables are proposed to provide a reasonable conclusion to the final data report:  
1. Youth baseball players can be evaluated on categories that matter in a form of potential salary estimator. 
2. Team managers can have a better idea of their players’ salaries whether they are being overpaid or underpaid. 
3. Baseball players can have a better idea of their salaries to choose whether they should move or stay in the team. 

The final conclusion of the data report is that a players’ popularity and votes are more significant factors than batting, fielding, or pitching records to their salary.
